# Game-Jam-Game-Show
This is my solo developed game for a game jam. For the game jam I had 2 weeks to develop a game around the theme *Game Show*.
The game can be found here: https://griny.itch.io/gameshowtemp

Features:
* Min-Max AI
* Modular weapon system
* Dialogue tree system
* Flexible character movement system

Bugs:

* AI rarely gets stuck
* Second level repeats instead of ending
