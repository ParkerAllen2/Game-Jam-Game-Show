# Game-Jam-Game-Show
This is my solo developed game for a game jam. For the game jam I had 2 weeks to develop a game around the theme *Game Show*.
The game can be found here: https://griny.itch.io/gameshowtemp

Bugs:
* Music doesn't trransition properly
* AI rarely gets stuck
* Second level repeats instead of ending
